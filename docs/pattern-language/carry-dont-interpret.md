# CARRY, DON'T INTERPRET ★★

**consider first**: [INDEPENDENTLY INVOCABLE UNITS](independently-invocable-units.md),
[SUSPEND WITHOUT BLOCKING](suspend-without-blocking.md)

**forces**: when a step suspends, the system must persist enough to
resume it later. steps have internal continuation state — thread IDs,
checkpoints, partial results — that varies by implementation.

if the orchestrator interprets step state, it couples to every step
implementation. add a new step type, update the orchestrator. change a
step's internal format, update the orchestrator. the orchestrator becomes
a bottleneck that must understand all steps simultaneously.

but opacity has costs. operations and debugging benefit from visibility
into what steps are doing. the temptation to let the orchestrator peek
inside — to validate, normalize, display — recurs every time someone
adds a new step, builds a dashboard, or debugs a stuck workflow.

**therefore**: steps return an opaque continuation that the orchestrator
stores and returns unchanged on resume. only the step that produced the
state interprets it. if the orchestrator needs visibility, extract a
small stable set of shared metadata (status, timing, identity) separate
from the opaque payload.

**intended consequences**:

- ✓ orchestrator stays generic — no coupling to step internals
- ✓ steps evolve their continuation format independently
- ✓ adding a new step type requires no orchestrator changes
- △ deep inspection requires step-owned tooling, not central queries
- △ version migration of opaque state is a step concern

## in this codebase

**journal queue entries**: `JournalQueueEntry` schema captures harness-agnostic
metadata (harness, retrieval method, context). each harness adapter
interprets its own retrieval payload:

```typescript
// queue entry carries opaque retrieval payload
{
  harness: "amp",
  retrieval: {
    method: "amp-thread",
    threadId: "T-abc123"  // amp adapter interprets this
  }
}

// consolidation fetches history per-method
if (entry.retrieval.method === "amp-thread") {
  const history = await fetchAmpThreadHistory(entry.retrieval.threadId);
}
```

**cross-links**: `[[id__XXXXXX]]` syntax is opaque to the filesystem.
`resolveIntraBatchLinks()` in `src/prompts/consolidate.ts` resolves
pending references within a batch before write.
